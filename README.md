It is program, which interpolate function via Bessel's, The First Newton's, The Second Newton's or Lagrange's formula. 

First of all CLI (Command Line Interface) of this program will ask you whether you would like to input function with two independent variables.  Please, choose yes ("y") or no ("n").

After your answer, program will ask you if step of independent variable(s) is constant. You should answer "y" (yes) or "n" (no). If "y", you will be asking about begin value, end value and step of independent variable(s).
Space is delimiter between minimum value, maximum value and step. If "n", program will ask you input values of each independent variable (space is delimiter of values).  Then you will be asking about function value with each argument.

Then the program will ask you to input the point you want to calculate the value of function. It will be calculated via Bessal's (Newton's, Lagrange's etc) formula. After your input the program  asks you, which interpolation formula
you would like to use to calculate value. You can choose 5 variants by pressing keys from "1" to "5". If you choose "5" option, program will select automatically, which interpolation formula to use, depending on which part of table
is the nearest for your value. Then program will show you the value you search and ask whether you would like to input another value. If you choose "y", program will wait from you input of value and after you finish input and press
"Enter", will ask you again, which interpolation formula you would like to use. Choose formula and program will show you searching value of function. If you choose "n" you will be asked to press any ket to exit and after pressing any
key program will be terminated. 

That`s all.
