It is program, which interpolate function via Bessel`s formula. 

First of all CLI (Command Line Interface) of this program will ask you input quantity of variables in function you would like to research. Please, input the number from 1 to 6.

If your previous input is right, program will ask you if step of independent variable(s) is constant. You should answer "y" (yes) or "n" (no). If "y", you will be asking about begin value, end value and step of independent variable.
Space is delimiter between minimum value, maximum value and step. If "n", program will ask you input values of each independent variable (space is delimiter of values).  Then you will be asking about function value with each argument.

Then the program will ask you to input the point you want to calculate the value of function, calculated via Bessal`s formula. Program will show you the value you search and wait from you for press any key.

That`s all. Program is terminated.
